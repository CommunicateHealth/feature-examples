  So that I can manage my finances more effectively

Scenario: Successful transfer between accounts
  Given I am a logged-in user
    And I have two accounts: "Checking" with a balance of $200 and "Savings" with a balance of $1000
  When I transfer $50 from my "Checking" account to my "Savings" account
  Then the balance of my "Checking" account should be $150
    And the balance of my "Savings" account should be $1050

    And the balance of my "Checking" account should remain $50
